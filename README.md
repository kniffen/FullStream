# FullStream

> An alternative interface for browsing and viewing Twitch.tv content

FullStream is an alternative and simplified interface for browsing and viewing Twitch content.
It originated from wanting a solution to watch and browse Twitch at the same time in a fullscreen environment, hence the name.
Since then it has evolved to be more and more feature rich, though development was put on hold from late 2016 until early 2019.
